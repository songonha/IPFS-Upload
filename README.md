# IPFS Upload - Using Infura API

- This is a simple React App using which you can upload any file to IPFS and it will generate an IPFS hash and a link which can be then shared with people or used however you want.
- Since, Infura discontinued its free IPFS service you will need an API key to use it.

### Note

For WindowsOS use some linux based terminal emulator like [WSL](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/) or [GitBash](https://gitforwindows.org/)
